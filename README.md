# PyThanos

Keep your projects perfectly balanced by randomly deleting half of the files.

- Running this file will delete half of all files in the current directory and subdirectories.
- I generally do not recommend using this.
- If you **do** run this file, I'm not responsible for your megalomaniacal actions.
